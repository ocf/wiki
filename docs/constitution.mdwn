## Preamble

> We, the computer using community of the Berkeley campus of the University of California, provide by this Constitution an organization dedicated to the pursuit of obtaining and managing open computing resources. The intent of this organization is to provide an environment where no member of Berkeley's campus community is denied the computer resources he or she seeks. This group's spirit can be traced directly to the former Undergraduate Computing Facility, however this organization's membership is much more widely open. It is also the intent of this group to appeal to all members of the Berkeley campus community with unsatisfied computing needs and to provide a place for those interested in computing to fully explore that interest. It is the intention of this group that no small number of people ever control the accessibility of any OCF sponsored computing facility.
