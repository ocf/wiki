## spy changes

spy uses PulseAudio (package installed from wheezy to fix a latency
timing bug). spy users moved from audio group to pulse-access group,
losing access to ALSA and gaining access to PulseAudio. PulseAudio
configuration modified to run in system mode, allow users to load
modules, and some changes were made in PolicyKit to allow device
access.

If audio output is distorted, stop audio and start again. When
PulseAudio starts, sink is muted so it will need to be unmuted, see
~kiosk/shell. To received sound from RTP multicast, module-rtp-send
will need to be loaded, see ~kiosk/shell.

Cleaned up spy crontabs and because of espeak incompatibility now pipe
time announcements to mplayer.
