[[!meta title="Postfix"]]

The mail server is [[sandstorm|servers]]. This is where postfix runs and determines where to put the incoming mail.

# Enabling Mail for Virtual Hosts
When a virtual host name wants to enable mail sent to *\*@virtualhost.berkeley.edu*, edit the postfix config on [[sandstorm|servers]] as *root*. Relevant directory is */etc/postfix/ocfconfig*.

1. Add an entry for the new virtual host in *vhost-maps.pcre*.
1. Run *buildvirtual.sh*.
1. *service postfix reload* if *buildvirtual.sh* doesn't already do so.

Make sure that the virtual host is an *A record* (and not a *CNAME*) to the [[web server|servers]] and has the following *MX records*:

    5 sandstorm.ocf.berkeley.edu
    10 pestilence.ocf.berkeley.edu
