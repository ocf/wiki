There are several administrative powers granted to staff. Some of these are
orthogonal to each other and some require each other.

* /root Principal.
  * This principal grants the user the ability to change passwords.
  * This originates in `chpass' calling a script somewhere on the KDC, called `change-password'.
  * The permission to do this originates in the Kerberos ACL (kerberos:/etc/heimdal-kdc/kadmind.acl):

> username/root@OCF.BERKELEY.EDU change-password *@OCF.BERKELEY.EDU

* admin Group.
  * This group grants the user the ability to sudo (become root) on most OCF servers.
  * The ability to become root also requires the existence of a /root principal.
  * This originates from PAM configuration and /etc/sudoers.

> /etc/pam.d/sudo:
>
> \# OCF Config
> auth required /lib/security/pam_krb5.so alt_auth_map=%s/root only_alt_auth use_first_pass debug minimum_uid=1000
>
> /etc/sudoers:
>
> %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

* /admin Principal.
  * This principal grants the user the ability to write to LDAP and the ability to write to Kerberos.
  * These are in fact two separate things, but are typically granted at the same time.
  * The ability to write to LDAP originates in OpenLDAP configuration (ldap:/etc/ldap/slapd.conf):

> \# Allow read over ssl or kerberos, and write by only admins
> 
> access to * by sasl_ssf=56 dn.regex="^uid=[^,/]+/admin,cn=GSSAPI,cn=auth$$" write

  * The ability to write to Kerberos originates in the Kerberos ACL (kerberos:/etc/heimdal-kdc/kadmimd.acl):

> username/admin@OCF.BERKELEY.EDU             all

* Local root passwords.
  * This file holds local root access to OCF machines.
