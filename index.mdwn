# Welcome to the new OCF wiki

Our hard-working student volunteers (hereafter OCF staff) try to keep documentation plentiful and up-to-date, but it's always lagging behind.

We recommend starting off by reading the **[[FAQ]]**.

<!-- Remove ikiwiki internal files, custom internal files, and certain pages from page map -->
[[!map pages="* and

!ikiwiki and !ikiwiki/* and !local.css and !RecentChanges and !sandbox and !shortcuts and !smileys and !smileys/* and !style.css and !templates and !templates/* and !wikiicons/* and

!favicon.ico and !media/* and

!index and !servers/* and !staff/*" 

show="title"]]

If you're feeling adventurous, you may want to look at our **[[technical documentation|staff]]** meant for staff.

You may also want to take a look at our older wiki, which is more thorough but **increasingly outdated**:
