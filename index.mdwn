# OCF help wiki

Our hard-working student volunteers (hereafter OCF staff) try to keep documentation plentiful and up-to-date, but it's always lagging behind.

We recommend starting off by reading the **[[FAQ]]**. If you experience difficulties that can't be answered here, feel free to [[contact us|contact]].

## Staff documentation

If you're feeling adventurous, you may want to look at our **[[technical documentation|staff]]** meant for staff.

## Old wiki

You may also want to take a look at our older wiki, which is more thorough but **increasingly outdated**:

 * [user documentation](http://docs.ocf.berkeley.edu/wiki/Help_and_Support)
 * [staff documentation](http://docs.ocf.berkeley.edu/staffwiki/Main_Menu)

## Blog

OCF server down? When all else fails, check **[the blog](http://status.ocf.berkeley.edu/)** for status reports and updates even when our network experiences a hangover.
