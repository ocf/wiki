# spy

## Jukebox

spy uses PulseAudio (package installed from wheezy to fix a latency timing bug). PulseAudio configuration changed to run in system mode (users need to be added to pulse-access group), allow users to load modules, and some changes may have been made in PolicyKit to allow device access.

When PulseAudio starts, the playback sink will need to be unmuted. To receive sound over the network using RTP multicast, module-rtp-send will need to be loaded. These are handled by a shell script.

A cronjob announces the time each hour using espeak piped to mplayer.
