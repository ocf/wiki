# Request Tracker

**Note:** RT is now fully-Puppeted, so these instructions aren't super useful
for OCF staff. This page is kept as a reference for others who might come
across it (it ranks pretty highly on Google). If you're one of these people,
you might also find [our Puppet code for installing
RT](https://github.com/ocf/puppet/tree/master/modules/ocf_rt) useful.

## Installation

Both Apache 2 and Nginx installation are listed below. Pick your poison...

1. Install required packages:

        sudo aptitude install mysql-server
        sudo aptitude install -t squeeze-backports request-tracker4 rt4-db-mysql

  **For Apache 2:** Install

        sudo install libapache-mod-auth-kerb
        sudo install -t squeeze-backports rt4-apache

  **For Nginx:** Install

        sudo install -t squeeze-backports nginx rt4-fcgi

  and enable the RT FastCGI daemon: in `/etc/default/rt4-fcgi`, edit:

        enabled=1

  Debian packages an obscenely old version of Nginx in stable, so please don't install that. People will laugh at you.

  Configuration by debconf:
     - Name: rt.ocf.berkeley.edu
     - Handle RT_SiteConfig.pm permissions: yes
     - SQL password: ....

  Install RT::Extension::CommandByMail and RT::Extension::MergeUsers:

        sudo cpan
        cpan> install RT::Extension::CommandByMail
        cpan> notest install RT::Extension::MergeUsers

  When prompted, the RT lib folder is located at `/usr/share/request-tracker4/lib`.

1. Copy site-specific RT configuration into `/etc/request-tracker4/RT_SiteConfig.d/99-ocf`: (this should be puppeted)

        # Debug - commented out for now
        #Set($LogToSTDERR, "debug");
        #Set($LogToSyslog, "debug");
        
        Set($WebDomain, 'rt.ocf.berkeley.edu');
        Set($WebBaseURL , "https://rt.ocf.berkeley.edu");
        Set($WebPort, 443);
        
        # Use external authentication provided by mod_auth_kerb
        Set($WebExternalAuth , 1);
        Set($WebFallbackToInternalAuth, 1);
        # tells RT to create users automatically if no user matching REMOTE_USER is found
        Set($WebExternalAuto, 1);
        Set($WebExternalGecos, undef);
        
        # Plugins
        Set(@MailPlugins, qw(Auth::MailFrom Filter::TakeAction));
        Set(@Plugins,(qw(RT::Extension::CommandByMail RT::Extension::MergeUsers)));
        
        # Make links clicky
        Set(@Active_MakeClicky, qw(httpurl_overwrite));
        
        # Non-fail To addresses
        Set($UseFriendlyToLine, 1);
        
        # Enable fulltext
        Set( %FullTextSearch,
            Enable     => 1,
            Indexed    => 1,
            Table      => 'AttachmentsIndex',
            MaxMatches => '10000',
        );
        
        # Use plain text instead of HTML email
        Set($MessageBoxRichText, undef);
        Set($PreferRichText, undef);

  Remove excess newlines courtesy of ikiwiki.

  Regenerate the resultant `RT_SiteConfig.pm` file:

        sudo update-rt-siteconfig

6. Ensure that SSL certificates for `rt.ocf.berkeley.edu` exist at the following locations:
* Certificate: `/etc/ssl/private/rt_ocf_berkeley_edu.crt`
* Certificate chain/bundle: `/etc/ssl/private/incommon.crt`
* Private key: `/etc/ssl/private/rt_ocf_berkeley_edu.key`

  **Nginx only:** Create a "chained" certificate file:

        cat rt_ocf_berkeley_edu.crt incommon.crt > rt_ocf_berkeley_edu.chained.crt

7. **For Apache 2:** Copy the following RT configuration file `rt` into `/etc/apache2/sites-available` and link to it from `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` (replace typhoon.ocf.berkeley.edu with the FQDN reported by `hostname -f`):

        # Apache configuration file for RT

        </VirtualHost>

  I would like to sincerely apologize for the terrible job ikiwiki has done of mangling this and promise it will look better soon.

  **For Nginx:** Copy the following RT configuration file `rt` into `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and link to it from `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`:

        # Configuration for RT on Nginx
        # rt.ocf.berkeley.edu

        server {
                listen 80;
                server_name rt.ocf.berkeley.edu;
                rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;
        }


        server {
                listen 443;
                server_name rt.ocf.berkeley.edu;
                rewrite ^/$ /rt;

                root /usr/share/request-tracker4;

                location /rt {
                        # See /usr/share/doc/rt4-fcgi/examples/request-tracker4.conf
                        expires epoch;

                        # Require the default authentication on typhoon (pam_krb5)
                        auth_pam "RT";
                        auth_pam_service_name "common-password";

                        # Proxy over to rt4.
                        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/rt4-fcgi.sock;
                        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
                        fastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $remote_user;
                        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME "/rt";
                }

                # Bypass FastCGI for images
                location /rt/NoAuth/images {
                        alias           /usr/share/request-tracker4/html/NoAuth/images/;
                }

                location /rt/REST/1.0/NoAuth {
                        allow           128.32.129.218; # sandstorm.ocf.berkeley.edu
                        deny            all;

                        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/rt4-fcgi.sock;
                        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
                        fastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $remote_user;
                        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME "/rt";
                }

                ssl on;

                # Same as apache
                ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/private/rt_ocf_berkeley_edu.chained.crt;

                ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        }

  Remove extraneous newlines inserted by ikiwiki.

8. **Apache 2 only:** Obtain a keytab for the principal HTTP/typhoon.ocf.berkeley.edu@OCF.BERKELEY.EDU (replace typhoon.ocf.berkeley.edu with the FQDN reported by `hostname -f`) and place it into `/etc/apache2/sites-available/rt.keytab`. Make sure it's only readable by www-data.

8. mod_auth_kerb/ngx_http_auth_pam uses HTTP Basic authorization which has no concept of login/logout. Emulate logout behavior by changing the Logout page to send a 401 (works for Chrome), run proprietary IE code (works for IE), and make an Ajax call to a non-existing page with bad credentials (works for Firefox).

  The below code has been "adapted" from [[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TrueHttpLogoutPatch]].

  This should be fixed so that RT's installation files aren't being directly modified.

  Edit `/usr/share/request-tracker4/html/NoAuth/Logout.html`:

  Change 
    
        <& /Elements/Header, Title => loc('Logout'), Refresh => RT->Config->Get('LogoutRefresh') &>

  to

        <& /Elements/Header, Title => loc('Logout') &>

  and paste the following below it:

        <script type="text/javascript">
        function clearAuthenticationCache() {
          try {
            var agent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
            if (agent.indexOf("msie") != -1) {
              // This works only on IE only.
              document.execCommand("ClearAuthenticationCache");
            }
            else {
              var xml = createXMLObject();
              // Let's prepare invalid credentials
              xml.open("GET", Math.random().toString(), true, "logout", "logout");
              xml.send("");
              xml.abort();
            }
          } catch (e) {
            return;
          }
        }

        function createXMLObject() {
          try {
            if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
              xml = new XMLHttpRequest();
            }
            else if (window.ActiveXObject) {
              xml = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
            }
          } catch (e) {
            xml = false
          }
          return xml;
        }

        clearAuthenticationCache();
        </script>
   
  Add the following before the end of the <%INIT> block at the end of the file:

        # "Force" logout due to using mod_auth_kerb -- Chrome
        $HTML::Mason::Commands::r->status(401);

  Clear the RT Mason cache.

        sudo rm -rf /var/cache/request-tracker4/*


8. **For Apache 2:** Restart Apache.

  **For Nginx:** Restart the RT FastCGI daemon.

        sudo service rt4-fcgi restart

9. Install the RT [mailgate program](http://requesttracker.wikia.com/wiki/EmailInterface#RT.27s_mail_gate) on the mail server.

  squeeze-backports is required here too.

        sudo aptitude install rt4-clients 

10. Set up rt@ocf.berkeley.edu to feed mail into rt-mailgate.

  Add or edit the following lines into `/var/mail/aliases/aliases`:

        rt: "|/usr/bin/rt-mailgate --queue General --action correspond --url https://rt.ocf.berkeley.edu/rt"
        rt-comment: "|/usr/bin/rt-mailgate --queue General --action comment --url https://rt.ocf.berkeley.edu/rt"

## Configuration

1. The RT root user can't log in while Kerberos password authentication is enabled because of the way `mod_auth_kerb/ngx_http_auth_pam` works. So, you must first log in with Kerberos credentials to create a user from Kerberos and grant superuser rights on it.

  Log in to RT. You will be auto-created and redirected to Self-Service.
  Disable Kerberos password authentication:

  **Apache 2:** Comment out the following lines in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/rt`:

        # AuthType Kerberos
        # Require valid-user

  and force-reload Apache configuration (`service apache2 force-reload`).

  **Nginx:** Comment out the following lines in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/rt`:

        # auth_pam "RT";
        # auth_pam_service_name "common-password";

  and restart Nginx (`service nginx restart`).

1. Visit RT again and log in as RT root.

  Go to Tools > Configuration > Users > Select, and type in your username in "Go to user". Enable **Let this user be granted rights (Privileged)**.

  Go to Tools > Configuration > Global > User Rights. On the left side, in Add User, type your name. Then, on the right side, click the tab **Rights for Administrators**, and enable **Do anything and everything**.

  Save changes.

  You will want to remove your superuser powers later because superusers may be artificially limited in rights elsewhere on RT for your own protection: ["Starting from version 3.2 (or 3.4?) RT doesn't show users with the SuperUser right in a ticket owner select-box."](http://requesttracker.wikia.com/wiki/SuperUser)

  Re-enable Kerberos password authentication in Apache configuration and force-reload Apache.

1. Create groups. I've created root and staff groups; this configuration may change as our use of RT is refined. 
  
  Go to Tools > Configuration > Groups > Create and create "Root" and "Staff" groups. 

  Add users to these groups by the **Members** subsection in the upper right corner of the group modification page. (You can also alter a user's group memberships from the user's modification page.)

  In this configuration I see the set of RT privileged users to be the same as the set of users in group "Staff". This may change.

2. Enable user rights. [This](http://requesttracker.wikia.com/wiki/Rights) guide is being followed.

  Go to Tools > Configuration > Global > Group Rights.

  **Save your changes each time you make changes to a group's rights.**

  Make sure the selected group is **Everyone**.

  Select the following rights:
    - Comment on tickets
    - Create tickets
    - Reply to tickets
    - View queue
    - View ticket summaries

  Now add a group to add permissions to, from the bottom left: Add Group

  Add these rights to "Staff", in the "Rights for Staff" tab:
    - Delete tickets
    - Modify one's own RT account
    - Modify tickets
    - Own tickets
    - Steal tickets
    - Take tickets
    - View private ticket commentary

  Add these rights to "Root", in the "Rights for Administrators" tab:
    - Everything except "Do anything and everything"

3. Miscellaneous configuration

  Change RT root's info so he can be a front for staff@. (Tools > Configuration > Users > Select, click root, change email to staff@ocf.berkeley.edu and Real Name to OCF Staff).

  Make the General queue sound better: Tools > Configuration > Queues > Select, click General, change Description to "OCF Staff". (I think changing the Queue Name would be nice too. If you do that, remember to change the parameters to rt-mailgate in `/var/mail/aliases/aliases` and re-run newaliases on sandstorm.)

  Add root as a watcher for General so staff@ gets automatically Cc'ed to new tickets. Click Watchers in the upper right corner and add root.

4. Send more mail. 

  By default RT only sends an autoreply to the requestor on ticket creation. Create a new scrip (RT callback) so that Cc (staff@) gets notified on ticket creation as well.

  Create that which is to be mailed: go to Tools > Configuration > Global > Templates > Create.

  Create a template with the name "Correspondence Creation" and description "For mailing staff on ticket creation, but without all that boilerplate". Keep type as "Perl". Paste this in as the content:

        RT-Attach-Message: yes
        Subject: {$Ticket->Subject}

        {$Transaction->Content()}

  Remove the second newline caused by using ikiwiki. 

  Save changes.

  Modify the scrip "On Create Notify AdminCcs" to use the template "Global Template: Correspondence Creation".

4. Send spoofed mail.

  Mail in the past has come from actual people, not endless drones of "via RT". Let's fake that for people who are uncomfortable with change. At the top of Correspondence, Admin Correspondence, Admin Comment, and Correspondence Creation templates, append the following below the last mail header that appears, if any exist:

        From: {
          my $u = $Transaction->CreatorObj;
          my $a = $u->EmailAddress;
          my $res = $u->RealName || $u->Name;
          $res .= " <".$a .">" ;
        $res; }

5. Automatically close tickets.

  This needs to be chained or something to send a template saying that the ticket is closed because it hasn't been modified in 30 days. I don't know what this entails, but the below is a start.

  Put the following into a crontab; you may want to create a rt system user to run this. 

        0 * * * * /usr/bin/rt-crontool --search RT::Search::FromSQL \
        --search-arg "LastUpdated < '5 days ago' AND Status = 'stalled'" \
        --action RT::Action::SetStatus --action-arg resolved

## Notes
* First-time autocreated users will have incorrect/embarrassing Real Names (for some reason, it grabs the gecos on occasion), so that should be fixed upon first login. Users can also update this information when they feel like it.

## Todo
* Fix Chrome double login, if possible.
** Doesn't occur when running Nginx, only Apache 2.
* Set up ticket autoclose using [[http://requesttracker.wikia.com/wiki/UntouchedInHours]] or [[http://requesttracker.wikia.com/wiki/TimedNotifications]]
