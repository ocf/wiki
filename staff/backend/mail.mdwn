# Mail

## External relations

We maintain relations with external groups for two reasons.

 1. To monitor our mail server reputation and prevent outgoing mail from
    being blocked by external service providers.
 2. To monitor abuse and disable compromised accounts.

When our IP addresses change, we need to update our registrations.
