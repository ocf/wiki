## Enabling virtual hosting

### Web

* Add vhost: edit `~staff/vhost/vhost.conf`.
* Update vhost configuration and restart Apache: run `sudo ~staff/vhost/web.sh` on death.

Request the following DNS record from the [University hostmaster](http://www.net.berkeley.edu/hostmaster/) (unless mail is also requested, in that case, skip to the next section):

    vhost.berkeley.edu. IN CNAME death.ocf.berkeley.edu.

### Mail (if requested)

* Add vhost: edit `~staff/vhost/vhost-mail.conf`.
* Update vhost configuration: Run `sudo ~staff/vhost/buildvirtual-mail.sh` on sandstorm.
* Reload vhost configuration: run `sudo service postfix reload` on sandstorm.

Request the following DNS records from the [University hostmaster](http://www.net.berkeley.edu/hostmaster/):

    vhost.berkeley.edu. IN A 169.229.10.23
    vhost.berkeley.edu. IN MX 5 sandstorm.ocf.berkeley.edu.
