# Digital Millennium Copyright Act

DMCA safe harbor provisions help "Online Service Providers" such as us avoid liability from copyright infringement by our users.

We are required to act upon a valid DMCA takedown notice sent to our designated agent (in the University), as specified on our [[contact]] page. A good example of instructions for a DMCA takedown notice is the [GitHub DMCA Takedown article](https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown).

Refer to [Guidelines for Compliance with the Online Service Provider Provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act](http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000472/DMCA), a 6-page document by the University of California.
