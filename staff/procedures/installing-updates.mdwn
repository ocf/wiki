# Installing updates with apt-dater

Installing updates requires root (`ocfroot` group). Besides that, anybody
should feel free to install updates at any time. Generally it is quite safe,
though you might want to keep an eye on important things to ensure they start
again after being updated (MySQL, LDAP, and Kerberos are the common offenders).


## apt-dater

We install updates using [apt-dater](https://www.ibh.de/apt-dater/). We wrap it
in a script that builds a list of hosts from LDAP.

To install updates:

1. From `supernova`, run:

       sudo apt-dater-ocf

   Wait for apt-dater to open (it will take a few seconds as it refreshes the
   list of packages installed on each host), then proceed to the next step
   without touching anything.

2. From a separate terminal, run (also on supernova):

       apt-dater-announce

   This will send an email to `root` with a list of packages to be updated.
   Glance over the list to make sure there are no obvious problems (for
   example, if it's trying to upgrade an entire system or install every
   available backport, which has actually happaned before).

   (This one should be on your path, and you don't need to execute it as root.)

3. Back in the apt-dater terminal, select the "Updates pending" row at the top,
   and hit `u`. You'll be asked if you wish to upgrade the entire group. Press
   `y` to confirm.

4. All the hosts will now be in the "Sessions" category. Expand it (select then
   hit enter), then attach to each host one-by-one (hit `a` when you're over a
   host). You'll attach to a screen session where the updates are being
   installed.

   In each session, wait for the updates to be installed, then press `q`. If
   "errors" are found, you'll be asked to review them before proceeding.

   These are full screen sessions, so you can, for example, use `Ctrl-A, D` to
   detach if your current session is taking a while.
