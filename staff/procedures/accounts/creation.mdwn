# Creating Accounts

Account creation is a process that requires root-level privileges. Accounts are generally created a week or two after they have been requested, depending on the schedule established by the current Site Manager.

# Instructions

It is recommended that you either start a *tmux* session or open multiple terminals, since it is common for problematic accounts (bad account name, duplicate account request, etc.) to appear and requre investigation during the process.

Account requests are queued and managed on *supernova*.

1. Run the create script:

        $ /opt/ocf/packages/create/create.py

1. Enter your kerberos credentials.
1. You should see an email to staff@ocf.berkeley.edu listing the accounts passed all the checks and are ready to be created.
1. Run the same script again to create the accounts (And filter any new requests that have been made since the last run)
1. If any requests need manual approval by a staff member, run the same script with the -i flag:

        $ /opt/ocf/packages/create/create.py -i

1. Keep a second shell open to search through approved.users and approved.log for duplicate account requests.
