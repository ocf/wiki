# `approve`
This page explains the OCF account approval procedure and the usage of the ("approve") script.

OCF group accounts need to be manually approved by staff in the lab. All members requesting individual accounts should be directed to the online approval. If a member requesting an individual account cannot use the online approval (likely because of an invalid/unacceptable CalNet id), direct them to an OCF officer.

Note that:

* CalLink organization ID is the number assigned by the university for registered student groups (see [[signat]] for more info), or 0 if not a student group or not registered with the LEAD Center.
* Approved users must be [[eligible for membership|membership/eligibility]].
* We recommend individuals responsible for a group account also request an individual account for themselves if they are eligible.

## Example usage

    $ approve    
    account_name: ocf
    callink_oid: 46187
    email: gm@ocf.berkeley.edu
    forward: true
    group_name: Open Computing Facility
    responsible: Dara Adib

    # Please ensure that:
    #  * Person requesting account is signatory of group (see signat)
    #  * Group does not have existing account (see checkacct)
    #  * Requested account name is based on group name
    #  * Paper form is signed
    #
    # To get the CalLink organization ID, use signat

    Account request recorded

### Prerequisites

* Group does not have an existing account (check with [[checkacct]]).
* Paper form is filled out and signed.
* For student groups registered with the LEAD Center, person requesting the account must be a signatory of the group (confirm with [[signat]]). Otherwise, the person should have documentation required by the [[membership eligibility|membership/eligibility]] page.
* Account name is based on group name.

### Post approval

Explain that the account will be created in approximately one week and that they will need to apply for [[virtual hosting|services/vhost]] (if desirable) after they have set up their site. Point them to relevant wiki articles.
