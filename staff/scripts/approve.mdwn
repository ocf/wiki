# `approve`
This page explains the OCF account approval procedure and the usage of the ("approve") script.

## Using approve
OCF group accounts need to be manually approved by staff in the lab. All members requesting individual accounts should be directed to the online approval page. If a member requesting an individual account cannot use the online approval system (likely because of an invalid/unacceptable CalNet id), direct them to an OCF officer.

## Procedure
First, check to see whether the group has an existing OCF account with [[checkacct]]. You should try different variants of the group's name as it may not have been correctly entered (eg. acronym etc.).
   
    $ checkacct Open
    Login: api            			Name: Open API Project
    Login: openu          			Name: Open University
    Login: oai            			Name: Open Access Initiative at Berkeley

If the group does not have an account, ask the requester to fill out and sign a form (located near the staff computer). 
For student groups registered with the LEAD Center, person requesting the account must be a signatory of the group (confirm with [[signat]]). Otherwise, the person should have documentation required by the [[membership eligibility|membership/eligibility]] page.
Check to see if the account name is based on group name.

* CalLink organization ID is the number assigned by the university for registered student groups (see [[signat]] for more info), or 0 if not a student group or not registered with the LEAD Center.
* Approved users must be [[eligible for membership|membership/eligibility]].
* We recommend individuals responsible for a group account also request an individual account for themselves if they are eligible.
