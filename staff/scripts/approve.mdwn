[[!meta title="approve: approve an OCF account"]]
# approve

This script records an account ("approve") for later creation. Right now you should direct users where possible to request their accounts online (ultimately this uses the same program). For some classes of users, like groups, online approve does not (currently) work.

Note that:

* University ID# is CalNet UID for individuals and OSL groupID for student groups (see [[signat]] for more info).
* Approved users must be [[eligible for membership|membership/eligibility]].
* We recommend individuals responsible for a group account also request an individual account for themselves if they are eligible.

## Example usage

    OCF Account Approval Program
    --------------------------
    Is this an (i)ndividual or (g)roup account? g
    Group name: Open Computing Facility 
    Requested account name: ocf
    Responsible student: Oski Bear
    University ID#: 15975
    Enter your email address: staff@ocf.berkeley.edu
      Enter again to confirm: staff@ocf.berkeley.edu
    Your OCF account includes an @OCF.Berkeley.EDU email address; would you like
    mail sent there to be forwarded to your personal email address? (y/n): y
    Choose a password (nothing will appear as you type): 
    Enter again to verify: 
    The account has been approved successfully
    Connection to supernova.ocf.berkeley.edu closed.

## OSL student groups

The vast majority of approvals will be for student groups registered with the University.

### Prerequisites

* Group has filled out an account form.
* Person requesting the approval is a signatory of the group (confirm with [[signat]]).
* Group does not have an existing account (check with [[checkacct]]).

### Approval

* Type in the group's full name in Group Name.
* Type in the group's OSL groupID (find this using [[signat]])
* Type in the desired account name (explain that this is not necessarily mean they will, or need to, get the same `.berkeley.edu` [[services/vhost]]).
* Type in the name of the student approving the account and email address.

### Post approval

Explain that that account will take 1-2 weeks to create and they will need to apply for virtual hosting after their site is ready. Point them to relevant wiki articles.
