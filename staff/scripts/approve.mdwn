[[!meta title="approve: record an OCF account request"]]
# approve

This script records an account ("approve") for later creation. Right now you should direct users to request their accounts online where possible (online approve does not work for groups).

Note that:

* OSL group ID is the number assigned by the university for registered student groups (see [[signat]] for more info), or 0 if not a student group.
* Approved users must be [[eligible for membership|membership/eligibility]].
* We recommend individuals responsible for a group account also request an individual account for themselves if they are eligible.

## Example usage

    $ approve
    account_name: ocf
    email: staff@ocf.berkeley.edu
    forward: true
    group_name: Open Computing Facility
    osl_gid: 12272
    responsible: Dara Adib
    
    # Please ensure that:
    #  * Person requesting account is signatory of group (see signat)
    #  * Group does not have existing account (see checkacct)
    #  * Requested account name is based on group name
    #  * Paper form is signed
    #
    # OSL group ID:
    #    To get the OSL group ID, you can use signat or look up online at:
    #    http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/studentgroups/public/index.asp
    #    (the SGID field in group name links is the OSL group ID)

    Account request recorded

## OSL student groups

The vast majority of requests will be for student groups registered with the University.

### Prerequisites

* Group does not have an existing account (check with [[checkacct]]).
* Paper form is filled out and signed.
* Person requesting the account is a signatory of the group (confirm with [[signat]] using their CalNet UID which can be looked up in the [CalNet directory](https://calnet.berkeley.edu/directory/)).
* Account name is based on group name.

### Post approval

Explain that the account will be created in approximately one week and that they will need to apply for [[virtual hosting|services/vhost]] (if desirable) after they have set up their site. Point them to relevant wiki articles.
