# signat

## Introduction

This Python script returns the OSL-registered student groups for which an OCF username or CalNet UID is a signatory.

For signatories without OCF accounts, you can lookup CalNet UIDs in the [CalNet directory](https://calnet.berkeley.edu/directory/). However, we strongly recommend that signatories [[request an individual account online|membership]], where you will be able to see their CalNet UID.

We require that a signatory be present (or authorize) any administrative tasks (account approval, password resets, and account enabling) for OSL-registered groups.

## Technical notes

The [OSL web service API](https://studentservices.berkeley.edu/WebServices/StudentGroupService/Service.asmx) provides an XML document for a given CalNet UID, which is parsed and output as a readable YAML document.

The signatory does not need to be publically listed on the [OSL website](http://campuslife.berkeley.edu/orgs/).

## Usage
    $ signat
    Returns student group information for an OSL signatory.
    OCF username or CalNet UID is the first and only argument.

    $ signat daradib
    Open Computing Facility:
      groupAcronym: OCF
      groupId: '12272'
      groupType: Registered
      status: Active
    Zoroastrian Student Organization:
      groupAcronym: ''
      groupId: '15975'
      groupType: Registered
      status: Active

    $ signat 872544
    Open Computing Facility:
      groupAcronym: OCF
      groupId: '12272'
      groupType: Registered
      status: Active
    Zoroastrian Student Organization:
      groupAcronym: ''
      groupId: '15975'
      groupType: Registered
      status: Active

## `signat.pl`

This older Perl script will list public signatories for student group names that match the argument string. It simply scrapes the [OSL website](http://campuslife.berkeley.edu/orgs) instead of querying an API.

### Usage

    $ signat.pl open computing
    Searching for 'open computing'...

    Open Computing Facility (OCF):
    Public Signatories:
    Mr. Dara Adib (daradib@ocf.berkeley.edu)
    Title:  General manager
    Mr. Kenneth H Do (kedo@rescomp.berkeley.edu)
    Sanjay Krishnan (SANJAYKRISHN@GMAIL.COM)
