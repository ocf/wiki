# account-tools (online account management)

account-tools is a django project for online password resets, account approvals, and command execution. 

## Technical warning
account-tools is installed on the webserver in _/var/www/account\_tools_, note the special permissions. account-tools requires privilege to change passwords, and as a result we need to be careful about ownership.

## Deploying Account Tools

1. Clone the git repo _https://github.com/ocf/account-tools.git_
2. Make sure the settings file exists at _/root/account\_tools\_settings.py.secret_
3. Run the setup script:

        $ python setup.py install --prefix=/var/www/account_tools
