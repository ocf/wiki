## Before contacting us (mini-FAQ)

Please make sure your question isn't already answered below.

1. It's been a week since I registered for an account, but I don't even know my password!

  Account creation consists of "approve" and "create. "Approve" is when we verify your eligibility for an account, which is done through CalNet now. "Create", on the other hand, is done manually in batches by a Site Manager, usually every 1-2 weeks. You will receive an email when your account is created.

2. How do I get <yourgroup>.berkeley.edu?

  First, your group needs to have an account. When it gets one, email [sm+vhost@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:sm+vhost@ocf.berkeley.edu) to request that address. (It's not automatic because we have to ask IST in turn for the address.)

## Email

We have several different mailing lists, each of which may be read by a different set of volunteers, depending on interest and knowledge. *In all cases, please remember not to send us your password over email, or we will disable your account.*

[help@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:help@ocf.berkeley.edu)

* The most general address -- any questions about OCF accounts, services, or anything else not covered below should be sent here. Your mail will be seen by all of staff, so will usually be answered much faster than if you mail any one staff member. (And you may get a better answer, since all our staff members have different areas of expertise, and you may not pick the best one for your question.)

[site-manager@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:site-manager@ocf.berkeley.edu)

* The OCF Site Manager(s) are responsible for running OCF machines and supervising OCF Staff. This is the place to mail if you would like to join OCF Staff, or if you have any comments/complaints about the actions of OCF Staff. Any staff decision, such as suspending an account for misuse, may be appealed to the Site Manager(s). 

[general-manager@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:general-manager@ocf.berkeley.edu)

* The OCF General Manager is in charge of managing the OCF organization, and serves as chair of the OCF Board of Directors. Any administrative matters not related to the operation of OCF computing services should be sent here. The General Manager is also the person who can hear appeals to overturn any decision of the OCF Site Manager. 

[BoD@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:bod@ocf.berkeley.edu)

* The OCF Board of Directors sets the policies for the OCF, and makes most major decisions. They can also overturn any decision made by the OCF General Manager or Site Managers, or OCF Staff. The Board generally meets weekly during the semester.

[paper@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:paper@ocf.berkeley.edu)

* The OCF Printer & Inventory Management Personnel(s) are available to answer questions about print quotas, paper usage, requests for page accounting reviews and for general OCF Inventory availability. Currently jointly managed by the OCF General Manager and Site Managers.

## In person

### When

Our *staff members* will be in the computing lab during the listed [staff hours](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/staff_hours.cgi).

The *OCF lab* is officially open weekdays from 9 AM to 6 PM, Saturdays from 11 AM to 6 PM, and Sundays from 12 PM to 5 PM. (OCF Staff may not be present during all of these hours.)

### Where

We are located in the basement of Hearst Gym (west entrance), Room 6A. You will need to show your student ID when you enter the OCF.

## Telephone
Phoning us is not the best way to reach OCF staff.  We check our email more often and are able to solve most problems that way.  If you must call us, please make sure to leave your name, OCF username (if you already have one), a phone number we can reach you at, and (preferably) an email address we can reach you at.

To leave a message at our voicemail box, call *81-OCFSTAFF (816-237-8233)*. Please note that this is a voicemail box only: you will not be able to speak to a human being by calling this number. While we make every effort to check our voicemail regularly, it may take several days to respond to phone queries.
