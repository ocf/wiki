There are several ways to contact the student volunteers who keep the OCF running (hereafter referred to as OCF staff). If your question cannot be answered by the **[[FAQ]]**, we ask that you try coming to **[staff hours](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/staff_hours)** before contacting us by email.

When contacting OCF staff (in person or remotely), please reference

 * your OCF account name (if known)
 * the software you are using and any error messages encountered (if applicable)
