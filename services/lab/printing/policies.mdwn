# OCF printing policies

## General

The OCF offers a certain amount of printing to individual members. Members exhausting their allotment **will not** be granted additional pages. Members may print single- or double-sided by selecting the corresponding printer at the print dialog.

## Restrictions and caveats

Printing is currently limited to:

 * 250 pages per semester (Fall or Spring)
 * [10 pages per day on weekdays](http://status.ocf.berkeley.edu/2013/10/printing-service-changes.html)
 * [30 pages per day on weekends](http://status.ocf.berkeley.edu/2013/02/printing-daily-quota.html)

Please note:

 * Each **printed side** of a sheet counts as a page.
 * Jobs take time to process proportional to the job size.  If you submit a large job, please be patient while the print server processes it.

## Member responsibilities

As a member of the OCF, you are responsible for taking the following precautions to safeguard your print balance:

* Cancel any unwanted print jobs via the [print queue](https://printhost.ocf.berkeley.edu:631/jobs/).
* Check the [print queue](https://printhost.ocf.berkeley.edu:631/jobs/) monitor to the right of the printers for the status of your job before trying to print again.
* Check your [print balance](https://accounts.ocf.berkeley.edu/commands) regularly, by web interface or by logging in to your account via SSH and issuing the `paper` command:

        tsunami$ paper

* Log off of lab computers when you are finished with them.

## Printing refunds

Pages are **not** normally refunded.

However, if an OCF staff member is present in the lab during physical printer malfunction (lack of toner, paper jam, etc.), he or she may be able to correct printing quotas. OCF staff are volunteers and are **not** usually present in the lab. The ASUC Publications Center receptionist cannot change OCF quotas.
