# Printing

The OCF offers a certain amount of printing to individual members. You don't have to request a new account each semester - the quota is refreshed at the start of each semester.

Printing is currently limited to:

 * 250 pages per semester
 * [10 pages per day on weekdays](http://status.ocf.berkeley.edu/2013/10/printing-service-changes.html)
 * [30 pages per day on weekends](http://status.ocf.berkeley.edu/2013/02/printing-daily-quota.html)

Please review our [[printing policies|printing/policies]] before contacting staff. Refer to the links above for an explanation of our printing policy changes.

## Remaining quota

To see how many pages you have left for the day and semester, run the `paper` command [over the web](https://secure.ocf.berkeley.edu/account_tools/commands) or [[in the shell|shell]]. Print quota is also displayed at the top of the screen when using a lab computer. Check your print balance regularly!

## Technical details

We currently have two HP LaserJet P4515x printers: deforestation and logjam.
