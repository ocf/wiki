# Virtual hosting

Virtual hosting lets your group's website be hosted on the OCF's web server, but be accessible at a different URL (typically from within the `berkeley.edu` namespace, e.g., `yourgroup.berkeley.edu`). Mail sent to `foo@yourgroup.berkeley.edu` (where `foo` is any recipient) can also be redirected to your group's mailbox if requested.

## Details

*   Virtual hosting is not enabled by default.
*   After the virtual host is set up, the files in the `public_html` directory of your group account (ordinarily accessible at `http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~accountname`) will appear at the root directory of the virtual-hosted site (`yourgroup.berkeley.edu`).
*   You can also request that all mail sent to your virtual host be redirected to your group account. You can forward the mail sent to different addresses in your virtual host by using `.forward+` files (note the leading dot). For example, if you have a file named `.forward+secretary` in your group account's home directory, all mail sent to `secretary@yourgroup.berkeley.edu` will be processed using the directions in this file (typically one or more email addresses to forward to, listed separately on each line). All other mail will be delivered to the group account mailbox. Mail virtual hosting may significantly increase the amount of spam received by the group account, and is not set up by default.

### Instructions

1.   [[Request an OCF group account|membership]] (if you haven't already done so). 
2.   Set up your webspace and upload your website (if you haven't already done so). The website should be developed already, not a placeholder.
3.   Place a [[Hosted by OCF banner|http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/images/hosted-logos/]] on your page that links to the OCF front page. If none of these images are appropriate for your site, you may design one of your own and [[submit it|contact]] for approval.
4.   Send a message to [[hostmaster@ocf.berkeley.edu|mailto:hostmaster@ocf.berkeley.edu]] with a request to set up a virtual host for your group's account. It should take 1-2 weeks to set up a new virtual host. Specify in the email what virtual host name your group wants. OCF will contact the University DNS hostmaster to obtain permission for your desired hostname (assuming it is available).

### Including the OCF banner

To place any of the [[Hosted by OCF banners|http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/images/hosted-logos/]] on your page, you can use HTML code such as the following:

    <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/">
    <img src="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/images/hosted-logos/ocfbadge_mini8.png" alt="Hosted by the OCF" width="98" height="39" style="border:0" />
    </a>

Remember, you can also create your own OCF banner with approval from the OCF (see instructions above).

### Policies

#### Groups only

The OCF only performs virtual hosting for OCF group accounts.

Each group account may have one virtual host. Requests for an exception to this rule must be approved by the OCF Board of Directors.

#### Limitations on non-berkeley.edu

The OCF may also host non-berkeley.edu domains. The process is more complicated in this case. Permission will be granted only for group accounts that can demonstrate a unique need for having a web site outside of the berkeley.edu domain. For such domains, the group account must:

 1.   Apply to the OCF Board of Directors for a permission to host this domain.
 2.   Pay any and all fees and/or obtain permissions relating to obtaining and maintaining a domain name.

#### University policies

Virtual web sites, just like other OCF user accounts, must comply with the relevant UC Berkeley [computer use policy](https://security.berkeley.edu/policy/usepolicy.html) and [DNS policy](https://security.berkeley.edu/policy/dns).

In particular,

*   **No off-site (third-party) hosting**: Circumventions around off-site hosting, including (but not limited to) proxies, redirects, and substantial inline frames (iframes) of non-berkeley.edu domains are not allowed. OCF does not process or advise off-site hosting requests, which can be [submitted directly to the university](https://offsitehosting.berkeley.edu/) (however, feel free to keep us informed if you have an existing OCF account).<br/>
In other words, to comply with university policy, OCF will only provide virtual hosting for websites that are substantially hosted on OCF servers.

#### Hosting badge

All virtual hosts on the OCF must include an [[OCF banner|http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/images/hosted-logos/]] on the front page that links to the [[OCF home page|http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/]]. The banner need not be displayed extremely prominently, but it must be noticeable without undue effort. If the banner is removed or misplaced, the OCF reserves the right to terminate the virtual hosting service. The hosting badge not only attributes the OCF but also distinguishes it from sites hosted by other University departments.
