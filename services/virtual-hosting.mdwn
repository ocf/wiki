# Virtual Hosting

Virtual hosting lets your group's website be hosted on the OCF's web server, but be accessible at a different URL (e.g., `yourgroup.berkeley.edu`). Mail sent to `foo@yourgroup.berkeley.edu` (where `foo` is any recipient) can also be redirected to your group's mailbox or elsewhere.

OCF provides virtual hosting for **group accounts only**.

## Details

*   Virtual hosting is not enabled by default.
*   After the virtual host is set up, the files in the `public_html` directory of your group account (ordinarily accessible at `http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~accountname`) will appear at the root directory of the virtual-hosted site (`yourgroup.berkeley.edu`).
*   You can also request that all mail sent to your virtual host be redirected to your group account. You can forward the mail sent to different addresses in your virtual host by using `.forward+` files (note the leading dot). For example, if you have a file named `.forward+secretary` in your group account's home directory, all mail sent to `secretary@yourgroup.berkeley.edu` will be processed using the directions in this file. All other mail will be delivered to the group account mailbox.

## Instructions

1.   Sign up for an OCF group account (if you haven't already done so). 
1.   Set up your webspace and upload your website (if you haven't already done so).
1.   Place a [[Hosted by OCF banner|http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/images/hosted-logos/]] on your page that links to the OCF front page. If none of these images are appropriate for your site, you may design one of your own and submit it to the [[OCF Site Manager|mailto:sm+virtlogo@ocf.berkeley.edu]] for approval.
1.   Send an email to [[sm+vhost@ocf.berkeley.edu|mailto:sm+vhost@ocf.berkeley.edu]] with a request to set up a virtual host for your group's account. It should take 1-2 weeks to set up a new virtual host. Specify in the email what virtual host name your group wants. 

## Including the OCF Banner

To place any of the [[Hosted by OCF banners|http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/images/hosted-logos/]] on your page. For example, you can use HTML code such as the following:

    <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu">
    <img src="ocfbadge_mini8.png" alt="Hosted by the OCF" style="border:0px;" />
    </a>

Remember, you can also create your own OCF banner with approval from the OCF (see the above instructions).

## Virtual Hosting Policies

*   **Groups Only**: The OCF performs virtual hosting only for OCF group accounts. If your group would like a virtual host within the Berkeley.EDU domain, you should follow the instructions in the next section titled "Instructions." The OCF will then contact the University DNS hostmaster to obtain permission for your desired hostname (assuming it is available).
*   **One virtual host per group**: Each group account may have one virtual host. Requests for more must be approved by the OCF Board of Directors.
*   **Non Berkeley.edu domains**: The OCF may also host non-Berkeley.EDU domains (.com domains are not allowed, however). The application process is slightly more complicated in this case. Permission will be granted only for group accounts that can demonstrate a unique need for having a web site outside of the Berkeley.EDU domain. For such domains, the group account must:
    1.   Apply to the OCF Board of Directors for a permission to host this domain.
    1.   Pay any and all fees and/or obtain permissions relating to obtaining and maintaining a domain name.
*   **Comply with UCB policies**: Virtual web sites, just like other OCF user accounts, must comply with the relevant [[UC Berkeley computer use policies|http://technology.berkeley.edu/policy/]].
*   **Include a hosting badge**: All virtual hosts on the OCF must include an [[OCF banner|http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/images/hosted-logos/]] on the front page that links to the [[OCF home page|http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/]]. The banner need not be displayed extremely prominently, but it must be noticeable without undue effort. If the banner is removed or misplaced, the OCF reserves the right to terminate the virtual hosting service. The hosting badge not only attributes the OCF but also distinguishes it from sites hosted by the University.
*   **No off-site hosting**: Circumventions around off-site hosting, including redirects to and substantial inline frames (iframes) of, non-Berkeley.EDU domains, are not allowed.
