To enable virtual hosting, edit `~staff/vhost.conf` from a NFS mounted machine. Then run `~staff/buildvirtual.pl` on death as root. You might have to restart Apache yourself.

To enable mail virtual hosting, edit `sandstorm:/etc/postfix/ocfconfig/vhost-maps.pcre` as root. Then run `sandstorm:/etc/postfix/ocfconfig.buildvirtual.sh`. Postfix will restart.
