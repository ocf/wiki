# WordPress

WordPress is a popular CMS (content management system) on the Web.

# Setting up WordPress

The easiest way to set up WordPress is via [[SSH|services/shell]]. Some simple
instructions:

1. Go to our [web-based SSH client](https://ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu/) and sign in
   with your username and password.

2. Create your web root by entering `makehttp` and hitting enter.

3. Create your MySQL database by entering `makemysql`. Copy the password it
   gives you -- you'll need it later.

4. Go to your web directory and download WordPress by entering these lines
   individually:

        cd ~/public_html
        wp core download

   This will download the latest version of WordPress into your web directory
   using [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/).

5. Visit your web admin dashboard and complete the installation process. Your
   website will be `https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~username` and the dashboard
   `https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~username/wp-admin`.

   You can choose whatever you want for most options, but you'll need to use:

   * **Database Name:** Your user name
   * **Database User Name:** Your user name
   * **Database Password:** Your MySQL password (the one you copied from step 3
	 above)
   * **Database Host:** `mysql`
   * **Table Prefix:** Anything you want (the default `wp_` is fine)

# Recovering a database password

The database password used by WordPress is recorded in the WordPress
configuration file `wp-config.php` on the line that looks like

    define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here');

If you ever need your password back, you can always find where WordPress is
installed (usually `~/public_html` or `~/public_html/wordpress`) and open
`wp-config.php` in an editor or get the password over SSH like so:

    cat ~/path/to/wordpress/wp-config.php | grep DB_PASSWORD

# Migrating from WordPress.com

If you already have a site hosted at WordPress.com and you'd like to move it to
OCF web hosting, for example, to become eligible for [[virtual
hosting|services/vhost]], you can move most of your website's functionality and
content to the OCF's servers. Generally, the process is simple and sites
migrated from WordPress.com hosting to the OCF function quite well, apart from
possible minor differences in the appearance of themes.

If you have an old WordPress installation lying around -- if you are replacing
an old student group website, for example -- you should archive it before
proceeding. See the example on our [[backup page|services/web/backups]] to
easily make a backup over SSH.

The basic steps to migration are as follows:

1. Follow the steps above to install WordPress on your OCF account.

2. Use the web admin dashboard to install all the themes and plugins you were
   using at WordPress.com

3. Log into your WordPress.com dashboard and go to `Tools > Export` to download
   and XML file with all your site's posts and content.

4. Log into the dashboard at your OCF WordPress installation and go to `Tools >
   Import > WordPress`, then upload the XMl file with all your content.

# Installing Jetpack

The Jetpack plugin as well as several others require a publicly accessible
XML-RPC file, which is not public by default. Before you can install Jetpack,
you need to add the following lines to the file `.htaccess` in your WordPress
folder:

    <Files "xmlrpc.php">
      order allow, deny
      allow from all
    </Files>

If `.htaccess` doesn't exist, create it and add the above lines.
