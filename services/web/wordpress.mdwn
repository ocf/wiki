WordPress is a popular CMS (content management system) on the Web.

# Setting Up WordPress

The easiest way to set up WordPress is via [[SSH|services/shell]]. Some simple
instructions:

1. Go to our [web-based SSH client](https://ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu/) and sign in
   with your username and password.

2. Create your web root by entering `makehttp` and hitting enter.

3. Create your MySQL database by entering `makemysql`. Copy the password it
   gives you -- you'll need it later.

4. Go to your web directory and download WordPress by entering these lines
   individually:

        cd ~/public_html
        wp core download

   This will download the latest version of WordPress into your web directory
   using [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/).

5. Visit your website and complete the installation process. Your website will
   be `https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~username`.

   You can choose whatever you want for most options, but you'll need to use:

   * **Database Name:** Your user name
   * **Database User Name:** Your user name
   * **Database Password:** Your MySQL password (the one you copied from step 3 above)
   * **Database Host:** `mysql`
   * **Table Prefix:** Anything you want (the default `wp_` is fine)
