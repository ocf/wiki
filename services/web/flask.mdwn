# Flask

Flask is a popular microframework for Python web development. Using it on the OCF servers requires only just a little extra configuration.

# Starting a Flask Project

1.    Make a directory in your ~/public_html directory:

        $ mkdir ~/public_html/flasky

1.    Go into the directory you just created, and create two files: *.htaccess* (note the dot), and *run.fcgi*.

* .htaccess:
        
            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteBase /
            RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
            # Change "username" and "flasky" to your username and whatever directory name you made in public_html, respectively
            RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /~username/flasky/run.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L]
        
* run.fcgi:
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            from flup.server.fcgi import WSGIServer
            from flaskyapplication import app
            
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                WSGIServer(app).run()

1.    Either add your application as a module in this folder or a subdirectory that will be treated as a python package:

* Case 1:

            /flaskyapplication.py
            /run.fcgi

* Case 2:

            /flaskyapplication
                /__init__.py
            /run.fcgi

1.   Write your application logic inside the module or package:

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        @app.route('/')
        def hello_world():
            return 'Hello World!'
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.run()

1.   Make the *run.fcgi* file you just created executable:

        $ chmod a+x ~/public_html/flasky/run.fcgi

1. Once your app has started running, changes you make to the Python code or
   templates won't take effect for a few hours. To apply changes immediately,
   you can touch the run.fcgi file with the command:

        $ touch run.fcgi
