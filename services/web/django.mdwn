# Django

Django is a popular web framework for Python applications.

# Starting a Django Project

The necessary scripts for you to create Django projects are installed on our login server, _ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu_.

1.   First, you will want to create a directory to store all of your Django projects. This directory should not be in your *public_html* directory.

        tsunami$ mkdir ~/projects

1.   Go into the directory you just created:

        tsunami$ cd ~/projects

1.  Create a new Django project. For this example, the project name will be "hatsune". You will want to stick with Python-friendly package and module names, as detailed in [[PEP 8|https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names]].

        tsunami$ django-admin startproject hatsune

1.   Go into the project directory you just created and edit the settings.py file with the necessary information:

        tsunami$ cd hatsune
        tsunami$ vim settings.py

1.   Change the permissions of the settings.py file, since it might have sensitive information like your database password!

        tsunami$ chmod go-rwx settings.py

1.   Create an app, edit it, and so on:

        tsunami$ django-admin startapp miku
        tsunami$ vim miku/views.py
        ...
        tsunami$ vim urls.py

1.    Make a directory in your ~/public_html directory:

        tsunami$ mkdir ~/public_html/hatsune

1.    Go into the directory you just created, and create two files: *.htaccess* (note the dot), and *run.fcgi*.

* .htaccess:
        
            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteBase /
            RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
            # Change "username" and "hatsune" to your username and whatever directory name you made in public_html, respectively
            RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /~username/hatsune/run.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L]
        
* run.fcgi:
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            import sys, os

            # Change this path to reflect the real directory where your django-project lives
            projects_location = "/home/k/ke/kedo/django"
            project_name = "hatsune"

            sys.path.insert(0, projects_location)
            sys.path.insert(1, os.path.join(projects_location, project_name))
            os.chdir(projects_location)

            os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = "%s.settings" % project_name

            from django.core.servers.fastcgi import runfastcgi
            runfastcgi(method="threaded", daemonize="false")

1.   Make the *run.fcgi* file you just created executable:

        tsunami$ chmod a+x run.fcgi

1. Double check that your *settings.py* file is *not* readable by any other users, and try not to leave DEBUG set to True in your settings.py. Also note that paths are very finicky for Django (and Python) projects, and incorrect paths will likely be the source of any problems.

1. Once your app has started running, changes you make to the Python code or
   templates won't take effect for a few hours. To apply changes immediately,
   you can touch the run.fcgi file with the command:

        tsunami$ touch run.fcgi
