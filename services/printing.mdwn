# Printing

The OCF offers a certain amount of printing (currently 250 pages) to individual accounts each semester. You don't have to request a new account each semester - the quota is refreshed at the start of each semester.

Please review our [[printing policies|printing/policies]] before contacting staff.

## Technical details

We currently have two HP LaserJet P4515x printers: deforestation and logjam.
