# Website hosting

All accounts include hosting with a web address at:

* [www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~user](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~user) (canonical version)
* [ocf.io/user](http://ocf.io/user) (shorter version)

You leave off the "www." or "~" (tilde) and it will be added.

Group accounts may also request a [[virtual host|services/vhost]] for another domain (e.g., group.berkeley.edu).

## Setting up web space

### via the web interface

1. Open the [[web commands interface|https://secure.ocf.berkeley.edu/account_tools/commands]] in your web browser.
2. Select the "makehttp" option. Enter your OCF username and password, and choose "Run command". You should see something like this in the output, assuming you entered your username and password correctly:

        public_html folder has been created successfully.

### via SSH

1. Login to your account via [[SSH|shell]].
2. After you go past all system messages, you will see prompt:

        tsunami$

    In this case, `tsunami` is the current logon server; you may see another name displayed. At this prompt, type `makehttp`. This command will create your web directory. Here's a sample screen output:

        tsunami$ makehttp
        public_html folder has been created successfully.

## Uploading Files

Upload files to your web space the same way you [[upload files to your OCF account|services/shell]] (typically SFTP if used remotely). The only difference is that files for your web space are placed in your `public_html` directory.

## Additional details

The web server runs Apache 2.2 with FastCGI (mod_fcgid), suEXEC, and suPHP. Access and error logs are accessible in `/opt/httpd` using [[SSH|shell]].

The web server itself runs as a dedicated user. If your .htaccess file is not world-readable (e.g., chmod 644), the web server will return the error "401 Forbidden".

PHP/CGI/FastCGI scripts are executed as your user, so they do not need to be world-readable. If they contain sensitive information (such as database passwords), you should make them private (e.g., chmod 600 or 700).

### Supported languages

* PHP 5.3
* Perl 5.10
* Python 2.6 and Django 1.4
* Ruby 1.8 and Rails 2.3

Other flavors of the day may work but are not currently supported.
