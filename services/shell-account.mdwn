# Shell Account

A shell account refers to a text-mode interface where commands can be run interactively, like a command-prompt. All OCF accounts are eligible for shell account access. You can access your shell account by logging into the Linux or Windows systems in the OCF computer laboratory or remotely via SSH/SFTP.

We support the following commonly used shell account tools (to name a few):

*   SSH: allows your to access your shell account via an encrypted connection
*   Subversion, Git, and Mercurial: version control software
*   Cron: allows you to automatically execute commands on a regular and scheduled basis 
*   vim and emacs: powerful and extensible text editors

## SSH

Your shell account can be controlled remotely using [SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell). The server name is <tt>ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu</tt> (<tt>tsunami</tt>).

On Unix-like (e.g., GNU/Linux and Mac OS X) systems, enter in the terminal:

    ssh username@ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu

On Windows systems, use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) (you'll want to [download](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) putty.exe):

* Host Name: <tt>ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu</tt>
* Port: 22

## SFTP

You can transfer files to your account using [SFTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol). SFTP is accessed over SSH, but you'll probably need to use another program, like [FireFTP](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireftp/) (Firefox addon), [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/) (Windows), [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) (Mac OS X, Windows), or Nautilus (GNU/Linux).

* Protocol: SFTP (or SSH)
* Host Name: <tt>ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu</tt>
* Port: 22
