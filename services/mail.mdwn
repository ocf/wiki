# Email

## Sending and receiving

### Receiving

It is most convenient to forward email with a `.forward` file in your [[home directory|shell]] containing the email address to forward to. However, if you do not forward email, it is stored in `/var/mail` (10 MB quota) and can be accessed using:

 * IMAP: `imap.ocf.berkeley.edu` (SSL/TLS required)
 * POP: `pop.ocf.berkeley.edu` (SSL/TLS required)
 * [webmail](https://webmail.ocf.berkeley.edu/)
 * mutt or alpine over [[SSH|shell]]

Email can be moved or archived in folders/mailboxes which are stored in your home directory (2 GB quota).

### Sending

To send email, use:

 * SMTP: `smtp.ocf.berkeley.edu` (SSL/TLS required)
 * [webmail](https://webmail.ocf.berkeley.edu/)
 * mutt or alpine over [[SSH|shell]]
 * PHP or CGI on the [[web server|web]]

## Spam filtering

Most spam is centrally rejected before receipt (at the SMTP stage), not in a spam folder. In the unlikely event that a message is misclassified as spam (false positive), the sender will receive a "bounce message" from their email provider. Please contact staff with the date/time and sender/recipient email addresses so that logs can be inspected.

Anti-spam techniques used by the OCF include:

 * access restriction lists ([Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_ACCESS_README.html))
 * greylisting ([Postgrey](http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/)) if the sending server is not whitelisted ([dnswl.org](http://www.dnswl.org/)) 
 * blocklist and forgery scoring ([policyd-weight](http://www.policyd-weight.org/))
 * message scanning ([ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/), [Message Sniffer](http://www.armresearch.com/products/sniffer.jsp), [SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/))
