# OCF account

[[!toc levels=3 startlevel=2]]

## Introduction

Your OCF account is both proof of your [[membership]] and the means by which you authenticate to the variety of [[services]] operated by OCF [[staff]]. Your OCF account is independent from CalNet. (Technical info: public account information and salted password hashes are stored in [[staff/backend/LDAP]] and [[staff/backend/Kerberos]] databases, respectively.)

Accounts are not normally deactivated after your membership [[membership/eligibility]] expires (e.g., graduation). In fact, we have active accounts dating back to at least 1995. However, this policy may change in the future: as a student organization, it wouldn't be fair on our successors to make a long-term commitment.

## Passwords

OCF staff members **do not need to know your password**. In fact, we can't "look it up" either since we don't store your password directly but rather a salted [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

Email is generally insecure, so please **do not send passwords over email** (especially not to OCF staff).

### Changing your password

#### Using CalNet

For individual accounts, you can [find your username or reset your password online](https://secure.ocf.berkeley.edu/account_tools/change_password) using CalNet (assuming you have CalNet access).

#### Over SSH

You can change your password over SSH if you know your current password.

Use [[SSH|shell]] to run the command `passwd` and follow the prompts as shown below. No text will appear when you are entering in a password, just press enter when done after each prompt.

    $ passwd 
    myusername@OCF.BERKELEY.EDU's Password: <my current password>
    New password: <my new password>
    Verifying - New password: <my new password>
    Success : Password changed

#### In person

If you are not able to use CalNet or SSH (for example, if you are a group and forgot your current password), you can meet a staff member in person during [staff hours](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/staff_hours.cgi).

Please bring sufficient documentation as listed on the [[membership eligibility|membership/eligibility]] page to demonstrate that you are authorized to reset the account password.

#### By postal mail

If you have forgotten your individual account password and are unable to use CalNet or meet a staff member in person, you may reset your password through postal mail. For security purposes, please include the following with your request:

* a **notarized** copy of your Cal ID

* a second piece of supporting ID

* a signed statement to the effect of:
> I, John Doe, authorize Open Computing Facility staff to reset my password. Enclosed is a copy of my ID.
* a requested new **temporary** password, which should be 8 or more characters long, not based on dictionary words, and include at least one character from each of the following character classes:
  * lowercase letters
  * uppercase letters
  * numbers
  * other symbols (e.g. [], {}, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, ())

* contact information so that we can notify you when your password reset has been processed

If you no longer have your Cal ID, you may substitute it with a government-issued ID.

Mail your request to our [[mailing address|contact/#index6h2]].

Once your password is reset, we strongly encourage you to change it over SSH (see above), so that you can be sure that no one else knows your password.

### MySQL

Access to your [[MySQL database|services/mysql]], if you have one, is protected by a separate password.

## Disabled accounts

Some common reasons accounts are disabled:

 * by request
 * security (e.g., account hijacked)
 * misuse (e.g., excessive use of resources, violation of University policies) 

Accounts may also be disabled if OCF staff need to contact you but cannot do so. Please check your OCF [[services/email]] regularly, or keep the email address in your <tt>.forward</tt> file up-to-date if you forward email.

Disabled accounts may eventually be scheduled for deletion.

To re-enable your account, you will need to see a Manager (gm, sm, or dm after the staff member's name) during [staff hours](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/staff_hours).
