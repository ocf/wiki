# MySQL database
The OCF provides each user with a MySQL database. Read the following sections for information about performing common MySQL tasks, and our rules and policies regarding MySQL.
## Policies
We limit users to 1 database, and this database has the same name as your username. As a user of shared database server we ask you to respect the community and refrain from any activities that will hurt the quality of service for other users. We understand this policy is vague, so our suggested maximum size for databases is 1GB, and for individual tables 256 MB. Storing large amounts of data is not a problem unless the server has to perform complex queries on this data.

## Web-based interface for editing
If you are looking for a familiar phpMyAdmin interface, visit <https://pma.ocf.berkeley.edu>.

## Creating a MySQL database
We have two options to create a database using the terminal or our web management tool.
### Web-based tool
Go to the website <https://accounts.ocf.berkeley.edu/commands> and type in your username and password. Select the option: <pre>makemysql â€” reset your MySQL database password, or create a new MySQL database</pre> and run the command. Note your password in a safe place.
### SSH Terminal
Log into the OCF via [[SSH|shell]], at the terminal prompt enter the command <pre>makemysql</pre>. Hit yes to confirm the operation. Note your password in a safe place.

## Reset Password
To reset a MySQL password simply follow the directions above for creating a MySQL database. This program WILL NOT DELETE an existing database.

## Accessing MySQL
Assuming your database is set up, in order to access it (or allow a web application to access it), you will need 4 pieces of information:

* Database Host: mysql
* Database Name: {your OCF username}
* Database User: {your OCF username}
* Database password: {your database password}

Note: Your database password is not the same as your OCF account password. It is a randomly generated password that was created when your database was created. To use your OCF MySQL database with a web application, enter the above information during the application's installation process.

To connect to the OCF's MySQL server using the MySQL client on an OCF machine, simply run the command:
<pre>mysql</pre>

This command will prompt you for your MySQL database password.

## Backing up a MySQL database

To backup your database (which you should probably do regularly), the basic command to use is

<pre>mysqldump [username] > backup</pre>

where username denotes your OCF username and <pre>backup</pre> is the name of the file you want to dump the contents of your database into. This command will prompt you for your MySQL password.

To see more options, try running

<pre>mysqldump --help</pre>

## Restoring a MySQL database from backup

If you need to restore your database from a backup (dump file) you made previously, you simply need to connect to the database and run the SQL commands in the dump file. To do this from the command line, use

<pre>mysql -D [username] < backup</pre>

where backup is the name of the file that contains the dumped data. As usual, this command will prompt you for your MySQL password.

## Using .my.cnf for passwordless access to MySQL

If you are using MySQL in a script or in another program, you will probably want to set it up so that the <pre>mysql</pre> call does not prompt for your password. While passing the -p option is the obvious way to achieve this, it is also ''very insecure'' because anyone on OCF can see the password while the mysql command is running. A better approach is to create a </pre>~/.my.cnf</pre> file with proper permissions that contains your MySQL password. To do this, enter the following commands: make sure you replace dbpasswd with the MySQL password given to you when you ran makemysql. 
<pre>
touch ~/.my.cnf
cat >> ~/.my.cnf << EOF
[client]
password = dbpasswd
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf
</pre>
And make sure that your .my.cnf has correct permissions by running
<pre>
$ls -l ~/.my.cnf
-rw-------  1 staff ocf 64 2005-11-15 16:16 /home/s/st/staff/.my.cnf
</pre>
Now the mysql command will automatically log you in, so you won't have to memorize or write down your MySQL password.

If you want to find out what other things you can do with .my.cnf, take a look at the .cnf files in <pre>/opt/local/packages/mysql/share/mysql/</pre>
