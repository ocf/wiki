# Introduction
The OCF provides each user with a MySQL database. We currently use the most recent version of the Debian package mysql-server-5.1. See the following sections for information about performing common MySQL tasks, and our rules and policies regarding MySQL.
## Policies
We limit users to 1 database, and this database has the same name as your username.

As a user of shared database server we ask you to respect the community and refrain from any activities that will hurt the quality of service for other users. We understand this policy is vague, so our suggested maximum size for databases is 1GB, and for individual tables 256 MB. Storing large amounts of data is not a problem unless the server has to perform complex queries on this data.

## Creating a MySQL database
We have two options to create a database using the terminal or our web management tool.
### Web-based tool
Go to the website https://secure.ocf.berkeley.edu/account_tools/commands, and type in your username and password. Select the option: makemysql â€” reset your MySQL database password, or create a new MySQL database (copy down the password somewhere SECURE), and run the command. Note your password in a safe place.
### SSH Terminal
Log into the OCF via [[SSH]], at the terminal prompt enter the command makemysql. Hit yes to confirm the operation. Note your password in a safe place.

## Reset Password
To reset a MySQL password simply follow the directions above for creating a MySQL database. This program WILL NOT DELETE an existing database.
