#signat

## Introduction

This script checks a OSL student group's public signatory list. For all administrative tasks: account approval, password resets, and account enabling; we require that a signatory is either present or authorizes the transaction.

## Technical notes
The script is stored in `/opt/ocf/bin/signat`, so it can be run from any machine that mounts `/opt/ocf/`

## Usage
    sanjayk[OCF]signat ocf
