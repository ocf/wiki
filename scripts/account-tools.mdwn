# Account Tools

Account Tools is a django project for online password resets, account approvals, and command execution. 

## Technical warning
Account Tools is installed on the webserver in _/var/www/account-tools, note the special permissions. Account Tool requires privilege to change passwords, and as a result we need to be careful about ownership.

## Deploying Account Tools

1. Clone the git repo _supernova:/opt/src/users/kedo/account-tools_
2. Make sure the settings file exists at _/root/account\_tools\_settings.py.secret_
3. Run the setup script:

        $ python setup.py install
