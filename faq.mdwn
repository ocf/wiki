### Why might I want an OCF account? What do I get? How do I use OCF services?

More specifically, we have a [[list of services|services]].

### It's been a week since I registered for an account, what happened!

See [[membership]].

### I have an account. Does it expire? Will it still work?

It should still work. If it's been inactive for several years, it may be disabled (see below). Our current policy is to leave accounts alone after graduation.

### My account is disabled.

To re-enable your account, you will need to see a Manager (gm, sm, or dm after the staff member's name) during [staff hours](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/staff_hours.cgi).

### I forgot my username or password.

See [[services/shell-account/passwords]].

### [[Web hosting|services/web]]: How do I get group.berkeley.edu ([[virtual hosting|services/vhost]])?

First, you need to have a group [[account|membership]] and a working [[website|services/web]]. Then, request [[virtual hosting|services/vhost]].

### [[Printing|services/lab/printing]]: I have a printing question/problem.

See [[printing|services/lab/printing]].

### I want to disable or delete my account.

If you want to disable your OCF account, please [[contact us|contact]] and provide your OCF username. If your account appears to still be active, we may ask for some evidence that you are the account owner. Currently, disabled accounts are stored or archived and can be *re-enabled* by request at a later date.

To permanently delete the contents of your account, you will need to have access to your account. Refer to our documentation about [[account passwords|services/shell-account/passwords]].
